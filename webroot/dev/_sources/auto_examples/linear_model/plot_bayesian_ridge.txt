=========================
Bayesian Ridge Regression
=========================

Computes a :ref:`bayesian_ridge_regression` on a synthetic dataset.

Compared to the OLS (ordinary least squares) estimator, the coefficient
weights are slightly shifted toward zeros, wich stabilises them.

As the prior on the weights is a Gaussian prior, the histogram of the
estimated weights is Gaussian.

The estimation of the model is done by iteratively maximizing the
marginal log-likelihood of the observations.
