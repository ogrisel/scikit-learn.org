Ensemble methods

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.ensemble

The goal of **ensemble methods** is to combine the predictions of several
models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve
generalizability / robustness over a single model.

Two families of ensemble methods are usually distinguished:

- In **averaging methods**, the driving principle is to build several
  models independently and then to average their predictions. On average,
  the combined model is usually better than any of the single model
  because its variance is reduced.

  **Examples:** Bagging methods, :ref:`Forests of randomized trees <forest>`...

- By contrast, in **boosting methods**, models are built sequentially and one
  tries to reduce the bias of the combined model. The motivation is to combine
  several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble.

  **Examples:** AdaBoost, Least Squares Boosting, Gradient Tree Boosting...


.. _forest:

Forests of randomized trees
===========================

The :mod:`sklearn.ensemble` module includes two averaging algorithms based
on randomized :ref:`decision trees <tree>`: the RandomForest algorithm
and the Extra-Trees method. Both algorithms are perturb-and-combine
techniques [B1998]_ specifically designed for trees. This means a diverse
set of classifiers is created by introducing randomness in the classifier
construction.  The prediction of the ensemble is given as the averaged
prediction of the individual classifiers.

As other classifiers, forest classifiers have to be fitted with two
arrays: an array X of size ``[n_samples, n_features]`` holding the
training samples, and an array Y of size ``[n_samples]`` holding the
target values (class labels) for the training samples::

    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
    >>> Y = [0, 1]
    >>> clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
    >>> clf = clf.fit(X, Y)

Random Forests
--------------
In random forests (see :class:`RandomForestClassifier` and
:class:`RandomForestRegressor` classes), each tree in the ensemble is
built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample)
from the training set. In addition, when splitting a node during the
construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the
best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the
best split among a random subset of the features. As a result of this
randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with
respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging,
its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the
increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.

In contrast to the original publication [B2001]_, the scikit-learn
implementation combines classifiers by averaging their probabilistic
prediction, instead of letting each classifier vote for a single class.


Extremely Randomized Trees
--------------------------

In extremely randomized trees (see :class:`ExtraTreesClassifier`
and :class:`ExtraTreesRegressor` classes), randomness goes one step
further in the way splits are computed. As in random forests, a random
subset of candidate features is used, but instead of looking for the
most discriminative thresholds, thresholds are drawn at random for each
candidate feature and the best of these randomly-generated thresholds is
picked as the splitting rule. This usually allows to reduce the variance
of the model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase
in bias::

    >>> from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    >>> X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, centers=100,
    ...     random_state=0)

    >>> clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, min_samples_split=1,
    ...     random_state=0)
    >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y)
    >>> scores.mean()                             # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.978...

    >>> clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, max_depth=None,
    ...     min_samples_split=1, random_state=0)
    >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y)
    >>> scores.mean()                             # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.999...

    >>> clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=10, max_depth=None,
    ...     min_samples_split=1, random_state=0)
    >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y)
    >>> scores.mean() > 0.999
    True

Parameters
----------

The main parameters to adjust when using these methods is ``n_estimators``
and ``max_features``. The former is the number of trees in the forest. The
larger the better, but also the longer it will take to compute. In
addition, note that results will stop getting significantly better
beyond a critical number of trees. The latter is the size of the random
subsets of features to consider when splitting a node. The lower the
greater the reduction of variance, but also the greater the increase in
bias. Empiricial good default values are ``max_features=n_features``
for regression problems, and ``max_features=sqrt(n_features)`` for
classification tasks (where ``n_features`` is the number of features
in the data). The best results are also usually reached when setting
``max_depth=None`` in combination with ``min_samples_split=1`` (i.e.,
when fully developping the trees). Bear in mind though that these values
are usually not optimal. The best parameter values should always be cross-
validated. In addition, note that bootstrap samples are used by default
in random forests (``bootstrap=True``) while the default strategy is to
use the original dataset for building extra-trees (``bootstrap=False``).

When training on large datasets, where runtime and memory requirements
are important, it might also be beneficial to adjust the ``min_density``
parameter, that controls a heuristic for speeding up computations in
each tree.  See :ref:`Complexity of trees<tree_complexity>` for details.


Parallelization
---------------

Finally, this module also features the parallel construction of the trees
and the parallel computation of the predictions through the ``n_jobs``
parameter. If ``n_jobs=k`` then computations are partitioned into
``k`` jobs, and run on ``k`` cores of the machine. If ``n_jobs=-1``
then all cores available on the machine are used. Note that because of
inter-process communication overhead, the speedup might not be linear
(i.e., using ``k`` jobs will unfortunately not be ``k`` times as
fast). Significant speedup can still be achieved though when building
a large number of trees, or when building a single tree requires a fair
amount of time (e.g., on large datasets).
