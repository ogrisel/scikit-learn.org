==============================================
L1 Penalty and Sparsity in Logistic Regression
==============================================

Comparison of the sparsity (percentage of zero coefficients) of solutions when
L1 and L2 penalty are used for different values of C. We can see that large
values of C give more freedom to the model.  Conversely, smaller values of C
constrain the model more. In the L1 penalty case, this leads to sparser
solutions.

We classify 8x8 images of digits into two classes: 0-4 against 5-9.
The visualization shows coefficients of the models for varying C.
