Machine Learning 101: General Concepts
======================================

Machine Learning is about building **programs with tunable parameters**
(typically an array of floating point values) that are adjusted
automatically so as to improve their behavior by **adapting to
previously seen data**.

Machine Learning can be considered a **subfield of Artificial
Intelligence** since those algorithms can be seen as building blocks
to make computers learn to behave more intelligently by somehow
**generalizing** rather that just storing and retrieving data items
like a database system would do.

   Decision boundary learned from two classes of data.

The following will introduce the main concepts used to qualify
machine learning algorithms as implemented in ``scikit-learn``:

- how to turn raw data info numerical arrays

- what is supervised learning

- what is unsupervised learning

- what is linearly separable data

- what is overfitting


Features and feature extraction
-------------------------------

Most machine learning algorithms implemented in ``scikit-learn``
expect a numpy array as input ``X``.  The expected shape of ``X`` is
``(n_samples, n_features)``.

:``n_samples``:

  The number of samples: each sample is an item to process (e.g.
  classify). A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a
  video, a row in database or CSV file, or whatever you can
  describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.

:``n_features``:

  The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to
  describe each item in a quantitative manner.


The number of features must be fixed in advance. However it can be
very high dimensional (e.g. millions of features) with most of them
being zeros for a given sample. In this case we may use ``scipy.sparse``
matrices instead of ``numpy`` arrays so as to make the data fit
in memory.


A simple example: the iris dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The machine learning community often uses a simple flowers database
where each row in the database (or CSV file) is a set of measurements
of an individual iris flower.
Each sample in this dataset is described by 4 features and can
belong to one of the target classes:

 :Features in the Iris dataset:

   0. sepal length in cm
   1. sepal width in cm
   2. petal length in cm
   3. petal width in cm

 :Target classes to predict:

   0. Iris Setosa
   1. Iris Versicolour
   2. Iris Virginica


``scikit-learn`` embeds a copy of the iris CSV file along with a
helper function to load it into numpy arrays::

  >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  >>> iris = load_iris()

.. note::

  To be able to copy and paste examples without taking care of the leading
  ``>>>`` and ``...`` prompt signs, enable the ipython doctest mode with:
  ``%doctest_mode``

The features of each sample flower are stored in the ``data`` attribute
of the dataset::

  >>> n_samples, n_features = iris.data.shape

  >>> n_samples
  150

  >>> n_features
  4

  >>> iris.data[0]
  array([ 5.1,  3.5,  1.4,  0.2])


The information about the class of each sample is stored in the
``target`` attribute of the dataset::

  >>> len(iris.target) == n_samples
  True

  >>> iris.target
  array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
         0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
         0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
         1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
         1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
         2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
         2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])

The names of the classes are stored in the last attribute, namely
``target_names``::

  >>> list(iris.target_names)
  ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica']


Handling categorical features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes people describe samples with categorical descriptors that
have no obvious numerical representation. For instance assume that
each flower is further described by a color name among a fixed list
of color names::

  color in ['purple', 'blue', 'red']

The simple way to turn this categorical feature into numerical
features suitable for machine learning is to create new features
for each distinct color name that can be valued to ``1.0`` if the
category is matching or ``0.0`` if not.

The enriched iris feature set would hence be in this case:

  0. sepal length in cm
  1. sepal width in cm
  2. petal length in cm
  3. petal width in cm
  4. color#purple (1.0 or 0.0)
  5. color#blue (1.0 or 0.0)
  6. color#red (1.0 or 0.0)


Extracting features from unstructured data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous example deals with features that are readily available
in a structured dataset with rows and columns of numerical or
categorical values.

However, **most of the produced data is not readily available in a
structured representation** such as SQL, CSV, XML, JSON or RDF.

Here is an overview of strategies to turn unstructed data items
into arrays of numerical features.


  :Text documents:

    Count the frequency of each word or pair of consecutive words
    in each document. This approach is called **Bag of Words**.

    Note: we include other file formats such as HTML and PDF in
    this category: an ad-hoc preprocessing step is required to
    extract the plain text in UTF-8 encoding for instance.


  :Images:

    - Rescale the picture to a fixed size and **take all the raw
      pixels values** (with or without luminosity normalization)

    - Take some transformation of the signal (gradients in each
      pixel, wavelets transforms...)

    - Compute the Euclidean, Manhattan or cosine **similarities of
      the sample to a set reference prototype images** aranged in a
      code book.  The code book may have been previously extracted
      from the same dataset using an unsupervised learning algorithm
      on the raw pixel signal.

      Each feature value is the distance to one element of the code
      book.

    - Perform **local feature extraction**: split the picture into
      small regions and perform feature extraction locally in each
      area.

      Then combine all the features of the individual areas into a
      single array.

  :Sounds:

    Same strategy as for images within a 1D space instead of 2D


Practical implementations of such feature extraction strategies
will be presented in the last sections of this tutorial.


Supervised Learning: ``model.fit(X, y)``

   Supervised Learning overview

A supervised learning algorithm makes the distinction between the
raw observed data ``X`` with shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` and
some label given to the model while training by some teacher. In
``scikit-learn`` this array is often noted ``y`` and has generally
the shape ``(n_samples,)``.

After training, the fitted model does no longer expect the ``y``
as an input: it will try to predict the most likely labels ``y_new``
for new a set of samples ``X_new``.

Depending on the nature of the target ``y``, supervised learning
can be given different names:

  - If ``y`` has values in a fixed set of **categorical outcomes**
    (represented by **integers**) the task to predict ``y`` is called
    **classification**.

  - If ``y`` has **floating point values** (e.g. to represent a price,
    a temperature, a size...), the task to predict ``y`` is called
    **regression**.


Classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


A first classifier example with ``scikit-learn``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the iris dataset example, suppose we are assigned the task to
guess the class of an individual flower given the measurements of
petals and sepals. This is a classification task, hence we have::

  >>> X, y = iris.data, iris.target

Once the data has this format it is trivial to train a classifier,
for instance a support vector machine with a linear kernel::

  >>> from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
  >>> clf = LinearSVC(C=150)

.. note::

    Whenever you import a scikit-learn class or function for the first time,
    you are advised to read the docstring by using the ``?`` magic suffix
    of ipython, for instance type: ``LinearSVC?``.


``clf`` is a statistical model that has parameters that control the
learning algorithm (those parameters are sometimes called the
hyperparameters). Those hyperparameters can be supplied by the
user in the constructor of the model. We will explain later how to choose
a good combination using either simple empirical rules or data
driven selection::

  >>> clf
  LinearSVC(C=150, class_weight=None, dual=True, fit_intercept=True,
       intercept_scaling=1, loss='l2', multi_class='ovr', penalty='l2',
       scale_C=True, tol=0.0001)

By default the real model parameters are not initialized. They will be
tuned automatically from the data by calling the ``fit`` method::

  >>> clf = clf.fit(X, y)

  >>> clf.coef_                         # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  array([[ 0.18...,  0.45..., -0.80..., -0.45...],
         [ 0.05..., -0.89...,  0.40..., -0.93...],
         [-0.85..., -0.98...,  1.38...,  1.86...]])

  >>> clf.intercept_                    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  array([ 0.10...,  1.67..., -1.70...])

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the most likely outcome on
unseen data. For instance let us define a list of simple sample that looks
like the first sample of the iris dataset::

  >>> X_new = [[ 5.0,  3.6,  1.3,  0.25]]

  >>> clf.predict(X_new)
  array([0], dtype=int32)

The outcome is ``0`` which is the id of the first iris class, namely
'setosa'.

The following figure places the location of the ``fit`` and ``predict``
calls on the previous flow diagram. The ``vec`` object is a vectorizer
used for feature extraction that is not used in the case of the iris
data (it already comes as vectors of features):


.. figure:: ../../auto_examples/tutorial/images/plot_ML_flow_chart_2.png

   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Flow diagram for supervised learning with scikit-learn

   Supervised Learning with scikit-learn


Some ``scikit-learn`` classifiers can further predict probabilities
of the outcome.  This is the case of logistic regression models::

  >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  >>> clf2 = LogisticRegression(C=150).fit(X, y)
  >>> clf2
  LogisticRegression(C=150, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
            intercept_scaling=1, penalty='l2', scale_C=True, tol=0.0001)

  >>> clf2.predict_proba(X_new)
  array([[  9.07512928e-01,   9.24770379e-02,   1.00343962e-05]])

This means that the model estimates that the sample in ``X_new`` has:

  - 91% likelyhood to belong to the 'setosa' class

  - ~9% likelyhood to belong to the 'versicolor' class

  - ~0% likelyhood to belong to the 'virginica' class

Of course, the ``predict`` method that outputs the label id of the
most likely outcome is also available::

  >>> clf2.predict(X_new)
  array([0], dtype=int32)

Regression is the task of predicting the value of a continuously varying

Unsupervised Learning: ``model.fit(X)``
---------------------------------------

   Unsupervised Learning overview

An unsupervised learning algorithm only uses a single set of
observations ``X`` with shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` and does
not use any kind of labels.

An unsupervised learning model will try to fit its parameters so
as to best summarize regularities found in the data.

The following introduces the main variants of unsupervised learning
algorithms, namely dimensionality reduction and clustering.


Dimensionality Reduction and visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dimensionality reduction is the task of deriving a set of **new artificial
features** that is **smaller** than the original feature set while
retaining **most of the variance** of the original data.


Normalization and visualization with PCA
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The most common technique for dimensionality reduction is called
**Principal Component Analysis**.

PCA can be done using linear combinations of the original features
using a truncated Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix ``X``
so as to project the data onto a base of the top singular vectors.

If the number of retained components is 2 or 3, PCA can be used to
visualize the dataset::

  >>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  >>> pca = PCA(n_components=2, whiten=True).fit(X)

Once fitted, the ``pca`` model exposes the singular vectors in the
``components_`` attribute::

  >>> pca.components_                                      # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  array([[ 0.17..., -0.04...,  0.41...,  0.17...],
         [-1.33..., -1.48...,  0.35...,  0.15...]])

  >>> pca.explained_variance_ratio_                        # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  array([ 0.92...,  0.05...])

  >>> pca.explained_variance_ratio_.sum()                  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  0.97...

Let us project the iris dataset along those first 3 dimensions::

  >>> X_pca = pca.transform(X)

The dataset has been "normalized", which means that the data is now centered on
both components with unit variance::

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> np.round(X_pca.mean(axis=0), decimals=5)
  array([-0.,  0.])

  >>> np.round(X_pca.std(axis=0), decimals=5)
  array([ 1.,  1.])

Furthermore the samples components do no longer carry any linear
correlation::

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> np.round(np.corrcoef(X_pca.T), decimals=5)
  array([[ 1., -0.],
         [-0.,  1.]])


And visualize the dataset using ``pylab``, for instance by defining the
following utility function::

  >>> import pylab as pl
  >>> from itertools import cycle
  >>> def plot_2D(data, target, target_names):
  ...     colors = cycle('rgbcmykw')
  ...     target_ids = range(len(target_names))
  ...     pl.figure()
  ...     for i, c, label in zip(target_ids, colors, target_names):
  ...         pl.scatter(data[target == i, 0], data[target == i, 1],
  ...                    c=c, label=label)
  ...     pl.legend()
  ...     pl.show()
  ...

Calling ``plot_2D(X_pca, iris.target, iris.target_names)`` will
display the following:

   2D PCA projection of the iris dataset

.. note::

  scikit-learn also provides implementation for various
  :ref:`manifold_learning` algorithm that might render more interesting
  visualization than PCA on complex data.



Other applications of dimensionality reduction
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dimensionality Reduction is not just useful for visualization of
high dimensional datasets. It can also be used as a preprocessing
step (often called data normalization) to help speed up supervised
machine learning methods that are not computationally efficient with high
``n_features`` such as SVM classifiers with gaussian kernels for
instance or that do not work well with linearly correlated features.

.. note::

  The default implementation of PCA computes the SVD of the full
  data matrix, which is not scalable when both ``n_samples`` and
  ``n_features`` are big (more that a few thousands).

  If you are interested in a number of components that is much
  smaller than both ``n_samples`` and ``n_features``, consider using
  :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA` instead.



Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~

Clustering is the task of gathering samples into groups of similar
samples according to some predefined similarity or dissimilarity
measure (such as the Euclidean distance).

For instance let us reuse the output of the 2D PCA of the iris
dataset and try to find 3 groups of samples using the simplest
clustering algorithm (KMeans)::

  >>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  >>> from numpy.random import RandomState
  >>> rng = RandomState(42)

  >>> kmeans = KMeans(3, random_state=rng).fit(X_pca)

  >>> np.round(kmeans.cluster_centers_, decimals=2)
  array([[ 1.02, -0.71],
         [ 0.33,  0.89],
         [-1.29, -0.44]])

  >>> kmeans.labels_[:10]
  array([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])

  >>> kmeans.labels_[-10:]
  array([0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

We can plot the assigned cluster labels instead of the target names
with::

   plot_2D(X_pca, kmeans.labels_, ["c0", "c1", "c2"])

Notable implementations of clustering models
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following are two well-known clustering algorithms. Like most
unsupervised learning models in the scikit, they expect the data
to be clustered to have the shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``:

:class:`sklearn.cluster.KMeans` and :class:`sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans`

  The simplest, yet effective clustering algorithm. Needs
  to be provided with the number of clusters in advance,
  and assumes that the data is normalized as input (for
  instance using :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.Scaler` or
  :class:`sklearn.decomposition.PCA` as preprocessor).

:class:`sklearn.cluster.MeanShift`

  Can find better looking clusters than KMeans but is not scalable
  to a high number of samples.

:class:`sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN`

  Can detect irregularly shaped clusters based on density, i.e. sparse regions
  in the input space are likely to become inter-cluster boundaries. Can also
  detect outliers (samples that are not part of a cluster).

:class:`sklearn.cluster.Ward`

  Hierarchical clustering computes a minim spanning tree between samples
  and cut it to find the required number of cluster. This can give good
  results on small to medium dataset. It further give the ability to
  give connectivity constraints between the samples.

Other clustering algorithms do not work with a data array of shape
``(n_samples, n_features)`` but directly with a precomputed affinity matrix
of shape ``(n_samples, n_samples)``:

:class:`sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation`

  Clustering algorithm based on message passing between data points.

:class:`sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering`

  KMeans applied to a projection of the normalized graph Laplacian:
  finds normalized graph cuts if the affinity matrix is interpreted
  as an adjacency matrix of a graph.

``DBSCAN`` can work with either an array of samples or an affinity matrix.

Applications of clustering
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here are some common applications of clustering algorithms:

- Building customer profiles for market analysis

- Grouping related web news (e.g. Google News) and websearch results

- Grouping related stock quotes for investment portfolio management

- Can be used as a preprocessing step for recommender systems

- Can be used to build a code book of prototype samples for unsupervised
  feature extraction for supervised learning algorithms


Linearly separable data
-----------------------

Some supervised learning problems can be solved by very simple
models (called generalized linear models) depending on the data.
Others simply don't.

To grasp the difference between the two cases, run the interactive
example from the ``examples`` folder of the ``scikit-learn`` source
distribution::

    % python $SKL_HOME/examples/applications/svm_gui.py

1. Put some data points belonging to one of the two target classes
   ('white' or 'black') using left click and right click.

2. Choose some parameters of a Support Vector Machine to be trained on
   this toy dataset (``n_samples`` is the number of clicks, ``n_features``
   is 2).

3. Click the Fit but to train the model and see the decision boundary.
   The accurracy of the model is displayed on stdout.

The following figures demonstrate one case where a linear model can
perfectly separate the two classes while the other is not linearly
separable (a model with a gaussian kernel is required in that case).

   not have been seperated by a simple linear model.


:Exercise:

  Fit a model that is able to solve the XOR problem using the GUI:
  the XOR problem is composed of 4 samples:

    - 2 white samples in the top-left and bottom-right corners

    - 2 black samples in the bottom-left and top-right corners

  **Question**: is the XOR problem linearly separable?

:Exercise:

   Construct a problem with less than 10 points where the predictive
   accuracy of the best linear model is 50%.

.. note:

  the higher the dimension of the feature space, the more likely
  the data is linearly separable: for instance this is often the
  case for text classification tasks.


Training set, test set and overfitting
--------------------------------------

The most common mistake beginners do when training statistical
models is too overestimate the predictive performance of their model
by computing the accurracy on the dataset used to train the model.

  **Never measure the quality of the model on the training dataset!**


The overfitting issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The problem lies in the fact that some models can be subject to the
**overfitting** issue: they can **learn the training data by heart**
without generalizing. The symptoms are:

  - the predictive accurracy on the data used for training can be excellent
    (sometimes 100%)

  - however, the models do little better than random prediction when facing
    new data that was not part of the training set

If you evaluate your model on your training data you won't be able to tell
whether your model is overfitting or not.


Solutions to overfitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The solution to this issue is twofold:

  1. Split your data into two sets to detect overfitting situations:

    - one for training and model selection: the **training set**

    - one for evaluation: the **test set**

  2. Avoid overfitting by using **simpler models** (e.g. linear
     classifiers instead of gaussian kernel SVM) or by **increasing the
     regularization** parameter of the model if available (see the
     docstring of the model for details)

When the amount of labeled data available is small, it may not be feasible
to construct training and test sets. In that case, use **cross validation**:
divide the dataset into ten parts of (roughly) equal size, then for each of
these ten parts, train the classifier on the other nine and test on the
held-out part.


Measuring classification performance on a test set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example on you to split the data on the iris dataset using
the :func:`sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` helper function::

  >>> from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

This function will split any dataset by applying random shuffling and selecting
a fraction of the sample as held out test set::

  >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
  ...    iris.data, iris.target, test_fraction=0.333, random_state=42)

  >>> X_train.shape
  (100, 4)

  >>> X_test.shape
  (50, 4)

  >>> y_train.shape
  (100,)

  >>> y_test.shape
  (50,)

We can now re-train a new linear classifier on the training set only::

  >>> clf = LinearSVC(C=150).fit(X_train, y_train)

To evaluate its quality we can compute the average number of correct
classifications on the test set::

  >>> np.mean(clf.predict(X_test) == y_test)              # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  0.979...

This shows that the model has a predictive accurracy very close to 100%
which means that the classification model was capable of generalizing
what was learned from the training set to the test set: this is rarely
so easy on real life datasets as we will see in the following chapter.


Measuring performance using cross-validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simple train / test split gives one value the impact of the random
shuffling and split is unknown. To get a better idea of the variance
of the generalization score one can repeat the process several times
using cross-validation.

Let's build a new, untrained classifier::

  >>> clf = LinearSVC(C=150)

We can use the :func:`sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score` utility to
perform Cross-Validation in a single call::

  >>> from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score
  >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=10)
  >>> scores
  array([ 1.        ,  0.86666667,  0.93333333,  1.        ,  1.        ,
          0.86666667,  0.93333333,  1.        ,  1.        ,  1.        ])


This generalization performance can be summarized by the mean and standard
deviation::

  >>> scores.mean(), scores.std()                         # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  (0.959..., 0.053...)

There are many ways to do cross-validation, more details available in the
:ref:`cross_validation` section of the documentation.


Key takeaway points
-------------------

- Build ``X`` (features vectors) with shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``

- Supervised learning: ``clf.fit(X, y)`` and then ``clf.predict(X_new)``

  - Classification: ``y`` is an array of integers

  - Regression: ``y`` is an array of floats

- Unsupervised learning: ``clf.fit(X)``

  - Dimensionality Reduction with ``clf.transform(X_new)``

    - for visualization

    - for scalability

  - Clustering finds group id for each sample

- Some models work much better with data normalized with PCA but also
  simpler :ref:`preprocessing` schemes such as centering and
  variance scaling.

- Simple linear models can fail completely (non linearly separable data)

- Simple linear models often very useful in practice (esp. with
  large ``n_features``)

- Before starting to train a model: split train / test data:

  - Use training set for model selection and fitting.

  - Use test set for model evaluation.

  - Use cross-validation when your dataset is small.

- Complex models can overfit (learn by heart) the training data and
  fail to generalize correctly on test data:

  - **Try simpler models first**.

  - Tune the regularization parameter on a development set.
