.. topic:: Machine Learning for Text Analytics with scikit-learn

    ``scikit-learn`` is a Python module integrating classic machine
    learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python
    packages (`numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_, `scipy
    <http://www.scipy.org>`_, `matplotlib
    <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_).

    It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning
    problems that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various
    contexts: **machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and
    engineering**.
