=========================================
Feature importances with forests of trees
=========================================

This examples shows the use of forests of trees to evaluate the importance of
features on an artifical classification task. The red plots are the feature
importances of each individual tree, and the blue plot is the feature importance
of the whole forest.

As expected, the knee in the blue plot suggests that 3 features are informative,
while the remaining are not.
